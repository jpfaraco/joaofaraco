#### A Curious Mind

Brian Grazer, one of Hollywood’s most successful producers, asks people lots of questions, and he always has. He quizzes the rich, the powerful, the famous, the royal and the ordinary. He produced –and his partner Ron Howard directed –A Beautiful Mind, Apollo 13, Splash and 8 Mile among other films. Grazer also produced the TV show Arrested Development. He attributes his lifelong success amid Hollywood’s brutal power politics to his perseverance and his insatiable curiosity. From the beginning of his career, Grazer was not afraid to ask questions of anyone. His fearless curiosity propelled and sustained his rapid rise. He cites curiosity as the wellspring of many positive attributes, including courage, ambition and determination. Grazer and co-author Charles Fishman are engaging storytellers. They offer solid guidance on the application and utility of curiosity. Grazer’s ideas sometimes are as middlebrow as his films –and some are not quite the startling revelations he seems to believe. But the path of his career and the way curiosity informs it makes for fascinating storytelling. Of particular interest is the book’s final section, in which Grazer details encounters with Princess Diana, author Norman Mailer, studio head Lew Wasserman, then-Senator Barack Obama, and more. getAbstract recommends this engaging narrative to anyone interested in movies and to those cultivating ambition or curiosity.
