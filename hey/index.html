                <h3>What I do today</h3>
                <p>This year I made a career shift towards UX management at OLX. Today I manage 5 product designers who work in 9 different teams. This means my work is more about <span class="highlight">keeping a healthy culture, planning our UX strategy, coordinating the team and supporting them to do excellent work.</span></p>
                <aside class="callout"><p><strong>ü§îÔ∏è How do I feel about this?</strong> I honestly prefer the days when I was at a small startup, and got my hands dirty. I miss the short feedback loops and the freedom to experiment ‚Äì it felt a lot more like designing.</p>
                <p>Though now I have a broader influence on a product which is used by millions of people daily, I miss the hands-on work and the deep dives I used to do to understand people's specific needs and how we could design something to make their lives objectively better. But I really love that today I can work closely with this diverse group of amazing people, and help them grow professionally ‚Äì¬†this is really rewarding.</p></aside>
            </section>
            <section class="wrapper" id="how">
                <h3>How I design products</h3>
                <p>I've worked in both very individualistic environments and very collaborative ones, and I understand that we need to strike a balance between working alone and bringing in the team to collaborate.</p>
                <p>Each product asks for a different process of what basically boils down to <span class="highlight">(1) understanding the situation, (2) mapping what can be done to solve the complications, (3) figuring out how to solve the complications and (4) validating how effective the solution is.</span></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Understanding a situation means taking internal and external inputs and investigating why things happen. This may range from being a personal itch to something we see users complaining about. Many times capturing these inputs means doing exploratory studies by talking to people, and seeing how they use the product. My job as a designer is to conduct this discovery process and lay these insights out in a way that makes sense for the team to start seeing patterns, formulating hypotheses and ideating on how we can validate the hypotheses.
                        <aside class="callout">
                            <h4>üîéÔ∏è Product discovery methods and tools</h4> 
                            <p>The quarantine has definitely shaken things up lately. Not only have I learned to work remotely with the team, but also to keep in touch with our customers. Doing 1:1 exploratory interviews, looking at behavioral and attitudinal feedback and mapping the user journey always helps to give clarity over what we should focus on. For this I'm usually hopping between Miro, Airtable and Google Sheets.</p>
                        </aside>
                    </li>
                    <li>I'm not a big fan of ideation sessions that require people to get together and come up with a lot of ideas in a short period of time. I've seen that <span class="highlight">most times good ideas come when you're more relaxed and not under too much time or group pressure</span>. Ideas can come at any time, at any place, so I usually give everyone this time to reflect on the insights and think about what can be done, before consolidating with the rest of the team.</li>
                    <li>Ideas are usually prioritized and then we start sketching out how things should work more specifically, in the form of UI flows, rough wireframes or actual prototypes. For UI flows, <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows" target="_blank">Ryan's shorthand</a> has become the standard. When prototyping, I prefer to go high fidelity whenever possible, so that we avoid abstracting important details and can get good quality feedback before development.

                            <h4>üß∞Ô∏è Design tools</h4>
                            <p><span class="highlight">Photoshop never made sense for interaction design.</span> In fact, very few design tools model how interfaces are actually built. But Photoshop is probably the worst, and I have never used it for such. Today I use a combination of pen and paper, Miro, Figma, HTML/CSS, Protopie and a low-code tool called <a href="https://bubble.is" target="_blank">Bubble</a> to express my designs. I'm always eager to learn new tools, and am not afraid to open the Terminal and bang out some code if needed.</p>

                    <li>This is where the feedback loops happen. They may be fast or slow, depending on how we're validating the design, and it may happen while designing or in production. Either way, this is probably what got me addicted to digital product design in the first place ‚Äì¬†<span class="highlight">being able to quickly iterate on designs, experiment new solutions, learn new stuff along the way and see that we can constantly make people's lives better</span>.

                <h3>Why should we talk?</h3>
                <p>I really enjoy the current challenges at OLX, but I think working at Basecamp would stretch me to my full potential, something that I miss from when I worked in smaller teams. <span class="highlight">The fact that product designers at Basecamp are generalists that can perform all activities, from UX to front-end is the kind of profile I can really identify with.</span> That's why I decided to write this letter.</p>
                <p>Like so many people who follow Basecamp's blog, books, videos and podcasts, I think being a part of the team would be a dream come true. You guys really are an inspiration as to how work should be done ‚Äì¬†your products reflect that philosophy, and I want to be a part of it.</p>
                <aside class="callout">
                    üí≠Ô∏è <strong>But how can this Brazilian guy possibly design products in English?</strong> Worry you not, my friend ‚Äì¬†I've been fortunate to have grown up in Australia and England, so I'm quite fluent in the royal mother tongue.

                <h4>My principles</h4>
                <p>I follow a set of principles, which directly affects my work and the people who I work with:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>ABC ‚Äì¬†Always Be Curious.</li>
                    <li>Ego is the enemy.</li>
                    <li>Be excellent to each other, and everything will take care of itself.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>My skills</h4>
                <img src="skills.gif" class="centered"/>
                <p>I'm a classically trained designer, so my roots are strong in typography, gestalt, semiotics, visual communication and the usual graphic design tools. I've even published some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jpfaraco" target="_blank">Illustrator, Photoshop and Flash tutorials</a> back in the day, that people seemed to enjoy.</p>
                <p>I'm also a bit of a hacker. Though I don't get to practice every day, I'm fluent in HTML and CSS, and I think I can order a coffee with Javascript ‚Äì though last time I tried, they brought me kale ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è But hey, it got the job done anyway! A few freelance gigs and personal projects also unlocked me the Wordpress and SEO achievements.</p>
                <p>But these skills do not get used lightly. Whenever somebody comes up to me with "an idea for an app", I ask them if they really need an app. What are they trying to accomplish and why? How else might we solve the problem at hand, other than with an app? How are they solving it now, and what is actually missing? I end up doing contextual inquiry without people noticing. I map out systems and visualize data so that patterns emerge. Then we can <span class="highlight">focus on building the right thing before building the thing right.</span></p>
